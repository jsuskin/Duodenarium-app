Welcome to my music blog (in progress)! I am an audiophile and have created this app as an outlet to post songs daily that resonate with me. Once online, I will be posting twelve songs a day in the hopes that others can find something special, as I have! Happy hunting!

For the front end, I have utilized:

- ReactJS
- Semantic UI
- Moment.js
- react-player
